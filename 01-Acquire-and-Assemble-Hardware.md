Because this guide is written for the non-technical-yet-curious, I highly recommend you acquire the **Official Hardware** listed below. In my limited experience, I learned that something as trivial as a particular brand of USB cord can make the difference between euphoria and despair. Absolve yourself of hours and hours of needless troubleshooting and purchase the following:

| Hardware | Notes | Link |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **RockPro64 single board computer** | Spring for the 4gb RAM version. | [https://pine64.com/product-category/rockpro64/](https://pine64.com/product-category/rockpro64/) |
| **Pine64 NAS Case** | This comes with the case and SATA cables, but you'll need to buy a few more accessories for it (included below). | [https://pine64.com/product-category/rockpro64/](https://pine64.com/product-category/rockpro64/) |
| **Power Supply** | To minimize variables and potential issues, purchase the power supply directly from Pine64, but you can also purchase a generic 12V/5A power supply from wherever. | [https://pine64.com/product/rockpro64-12v-5a-us-power-supply/](https://pine64.com/product/rockpro64-12v-5a-us-power-supply/) |
| **PCIe To Dual SATA-III Interface Card** |  | [https://pine64.com/product/pcie-to-dual-sata-iii-interface-card/](https://pine64.com/product/pcie-to-dual-sata-iii-interface-card/) |
| **NAS Case Fan** |  | [https://pine64.com/product/fan-for-rockpro64-metal-desktop-nas-casing/](https://pine64.com/product/fan-for-rockpro64-metal-desktop-nas-casing/) |
| **ROCKPro64 30mm Tall Profile Heatsink** |  | [https://pine64.com/product/rockpro64-30mm-tall-profile-heatsink/](https://pine64.com/product/rockpro64-30mm-tall-profile-heatsink/) |
| **Two SATA SSD Drives** | 250gb+ In this guide we will be combining two SSDs into a single RAID drive (two drives that act as one for failsafe reasons), but you can opt to use a single drive, or HDD, or what have you. | [https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1581254-REG/seagate_za1000nm1a002_1tb_ironwolf_125_sata.html](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1581254-REG/seagate_za1000nm1a002_1tb_ironwolf_125_sata.html) |
| **One MicroSD** | 8gb+. I've read that these are prone to failure due to wear and tear from non-stop  reading and writing, so consider getting an "industrial" grade. | [https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1466561-REG/sandisk_sdsqqnr_032g_an6ia_high_endurance_microsd_32gb.html/overview](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1466561-REG/sandisk_sdsqqnr_032g_an6ia_high_endurance_microsd_32gb.html/overview) |

You can purchase the above from these suppliers:
- https://pine64.com/
- https://ameridroid.com/

If ordering from Pine64, I recommend you pay the premium for UPS shipping as they are located in China. UPS will get it to you in a few days once it's shipped; otherwise, expect to wait a month. AmeriDroid is located in the US, though they may not have everything in stock.

## Assembly
Assembling your server is easy and straight forward. Grab a screw driver and watch this video:
