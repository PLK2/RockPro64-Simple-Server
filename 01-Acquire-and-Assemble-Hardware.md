# 01 - Acquire and Assemble the Hardware

Because this guide is written for the non-technical-yet-curious, I highly recommend you acquire the *Official Hardware*, listed below. In my limited experience, I learned that something as trivial as a particular brand of USB cord can be the difference between euphoria and despair. Absolve yourself of hours and hours of needless troubleshooting and purchase the following:

- **RockPro64 single board computer** (SBC) with 4gb RAM
- **Pine64 NAS Case** with fan and cables
- **Two SSD Drives**
- **One MicroSD**
- **Power Supply**

You can purchase the above from these suppliers:
- https://pine64.com/
- https://ameridroid.com/

When ordering from Pine, I recommend you pay the premium for UPS shipping as they are located in China. UPS will get it to you in a few days once it's shipped; otherwise, expect to wait a month. AmeriDroid is located in the US, though they may not have everything in stock.
