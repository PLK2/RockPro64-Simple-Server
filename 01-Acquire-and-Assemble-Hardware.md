# 01 - Acquire and Assemble the Hardware

Because this guide is written for the non-technical-yet-curious, I highly recommend you acquire the *Official Hardware* listed below. In my limited experience, I learned that something as trivial as a particular brand of USB cord can make the difference between euphoria and despair. Absolve yourself of hours and hours of needless troubleshooting and purchase the following:

| Hardware | Notes | Link |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **RockPro64 single board computer** | Spring for the 4gb RAM version. | https://pine64.com/product-category/rockpro64/ |
| **Pine64 NAS Case + accessories** | with fan and cables | https://pine64.com/product-category/rockpro64/ |
| **Two SSD Drives** | In this guide we will be combining two SSDs into a single RAID drive. You can still follow along easily if you opt to do a single SATA drive or some other arrangement. |  |
| **One MicroSD** | You can get by with 8gb. I've read that these are prone to failure due to non-stop wear and tear of reading and writing, so consider getting an "industrial" grade, though the read/write speeds may be compromised on those. |  |
| **Power Supply** | To minimize variables and potential issues, purchase the power supply directly from Pine64, but you can also purchase a generic 12V/5A power supply from wherever. | https://pine64.com/product/rockpro64-12v-5a-us-power-supply/ |

You can purchase the above from these suppliers:
- https://pine64.com/
- https://ameridroid.com/

If ordering from Pine64, I recommend you pay the premium for UPS shipping as they are located in China. UPS will get it to you in a few days once it's shipped; otherwise, expect to wait a month. AmeriDroid is located in the US, though they may not have everything in stock.
