KISS
The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools. Hence, the "stupid" refers to the relationship between the way things break and the sophistication available to repair them.

Rule of Least Power (use the smallest software you need; bigger 

This server will need to function both now and later. Spinning it up once is half the work; the other half is getting it back up when it goes does. And if you’re like me—someone who doesn’t work with computer code everyday—there’s a good chance you’ll at least forget the tedious details if not the big ideas. By designing a server that works for the future you (i.e., the stupider you) you will be more likely in a position to keep the server up for the long term.
This does not mean you should not experiment with adding features to your server. You should. But do it always with the KISS principle and keeping future upgrades segregated from past successes. This is what Docker does.


Based on the Long Now.

Longevity
With occasional maintenance, the server should reasonably be expected to function for 10 years.

Maintainability
The server should be maintainable with minimal coding know-how.

Transparency
It should be possible to determine operational principles of the server and its code by close inspection.

Evolvability
It should be possible to improve the server with time.

Scalability
It should be possible to increase the storage capacity of the server. However, increasing I/O (Input/Output) capacity would likely necessitate a new design.

### Longevity:
- Go slow
- Avoid sliding friction (gears)
- Avoid ticking
- Stay clean
- Stay dry
- Expect power outages
- Expect hardware failure
- Expect attacks
- Don't tempt hackers

### Maintainability and transparency:
- Use familiar hardware and code
- Allow inspection
- Rehearse backups and restarts
- Make it easy to buy spare parts
- Expect restarts
- Include the manual

### Scalability and Evolvabilty:
- Make all parts similar size
- Separate functions
- Provide simple interfaces

Longevity
With occasional maintenance, the clock should reasonably be expected to display the correct time for the next 10,000 years.

Maintainability
The clock should be maintainable with bronze-age technology.

Transparency
It should be possible to determine operational principles of the clock by close inspection.

Evolvability
It should be possible to improve the clock with time.

Scalability
It should be possible to build working models of the clock from table-top to monumental size using the same design.

Expect earthquakes
Expect non-malicious human interaction
