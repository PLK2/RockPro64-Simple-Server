# Appendix I - Principles for the Simple Server

Based on the Long Now.

Longevity
With occasional maintenance, the server should reasonably be expected to function for 10 years.

Maintainability
The server should be maintainable with minimal coding know-how.

Transparency
It should be possible to determine operational principles of the server and its code by close inspection.

Evolvability
It should be possible to improve the server with time.

Scalability
It should be possible to increase the storage capacity of the server. However, increasing I/O (Input/Output) capacity would likely necessitate a new design.

### Longevity:
- Go slow
- Avoid sliding friction (gears)
- Avoid ticking
- Stay clean
- Stay dry
- Expect power outages
- Expect hardware failure
- Expect attacks
- Don't tempt hackers

### Maintainability and transparency:
- Use familiar hardware and code
- Allow inspection
- Rehearse backups and restarts
- Make it easy to buy spare parts
- Expect restarts
- Include the manual

### Scalability and Evolvabilty:
- Make all parts similar size
- Separate functions
- Provide simple interfaces

Longevity
With occasional maintenance, the clock should reasonably be expected to display the correct time for the next 10,000 years.

Maintainability
The clock should be maintainable with bronze-age technology.

Transparency
It should be possible to determine operational principles of the clock by close inspection.

Evolvability
It should be possible to improve the clock with time.

Scalability
It should be possible to build working models of the clock from table-top to monumental size using the same design.

Longevity:
Go slow
Avoid sliding friction (gears)
Avoid ticking
Stay clean
Stay dry
Expect bad weather
Expect earthquakes
Expect non-malicious human interaction
Dont tempt thieves
Maintainability and transparency:
Use familiar materials
Allow inspection
Rehearse motions
Make it easy to build spare parts
Expect restarts
Include the manual
Scalability and Evolvabilty:
Make all parts similar size
