# Appendix III - Want to Add an App to your Server? First Consider a Separate Board.

It is tempting to persue a single, do-it-all server, but there are some good reasons to consider using separate boards, like:
- Decentralization: power, errors, etc.
- Experimentation
- If it ain't broke don't fix it.
- Focus, simplicity.
- Some applications are made specifically for the Raspberry Pi and haven't been built for the RockPro.

More thoughts on all this forthcoming...
