# Appendix III - Want to Add an App to your Server? First Consider a Separate Board.

It is tempting to think about having a single, do-it-all server. But it considering the pros and cons, there are some reasons to use a separate RockPro64 (or Raspberry Pi, etc).

Some applications are made for the raspberry pi and haven't been built for the RockPro. Rather than find out the hardware, it might be worth the extra 5 watts per day to run a separate SBC.
