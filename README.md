Stop paying Dropbox.

## Project Background
This project got started when I temporarily lost access to some bitcoin on a lightning wallet I had set up on a Raspberry Pi 4. At the time, I was interested enough to go through the process: acquiring the precisely-specced hardware, learning how to flash software, how to setup remote access, how to troubleshoot if the internet or power went out, etc. I had even purchased a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) and had remote access over Tor. It had been running smoothly and without issue for months when, suddenly, it died three days after I left for a two-week vacation.
After spending time on forums, digging into every possible reason for its failure, I ultimately learned it was a hardware issue. I had an external hard drive plugged into the USB3 port on the Raspberry Pi.

## Who is this guide for?
This guide is intended for the non-technical-yet-curious. Those people wanting more power and independence from Windows and Dropbox but have minimal (if any) coding experience. If you are one of those people, this guide will hold your hand while you code with the other. 
That said, while only minimal computer skills are required to get through this guide you should probably already know the following (or acquire the skills elsewhere):

1. How to access and adjust your home router settings.
2. What a "command line terminal" is.
3. How to SSH into a device on your home network.
4. Good password management.
5. Willingness to work with tedious details; patience to deal with errors that are frustratingly stupid in hindsight.
