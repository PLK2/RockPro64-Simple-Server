## Who is this guide for?
This guide is intended for the novice coder, the non-technical-yet-curious, or the Linux greenhorn; those of us looking for an escape route from Big Tech with better privacy and personal sovereignty. If you are one of those people, this guide is for you. It will hold your hand at each step while you spin up your own server with the other.

For more on the Principles behind this guide, see Appendix I.

While only minimal computer skills are required to get through this guide, it's best if you already know the following (or acquire the skills elsewhere):

1. How to access and adjust your home router settings.
2. Good password management is a critical best practice, especially when you're taking full custody of your information.
3. Willingness to work with tedious text details and patience to deal with errors that are frustratingly stupid in hindsight.

## Project Background
This project began after I temporarily lost access to some bitcoin on a lightning wallet I had set up on a Raspberry Pi 4. It was a "plug-and-play" node which meant it was easy to set up, but after I encountered the problem I quickly realized I had no idea what I was doing. I spent a lot of time on forums, DuckDuckGo, and YouTube, trying to decipher all the code-speak aand after a while I figured out it was a hardware issue (likely the USB ports on my Raspberry Pi, or perhaps the external drive itself). After much headache and heartache I recovered my funds. With hard money on the line I figured I had better learn how to manage it under the hood. That experience set me on a path to learn more about computers, servers, and coding, to better prepare myself for the inevitable upgrades and potential failures. In that process, I realized I could apply my new skills to build my own server. This guide is the result.

I didn't study computers in college and don't work with them professionaly; they're a side hobby for me. If you have the same interest, you can get through this guide.
