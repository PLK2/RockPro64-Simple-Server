# 05 - Preparing for the Future: Updates, Notes, Backup Data, Backup Power, and Upgrades

Computers aren't a "set it and forget it" endeavor. They require maintenance and protection against the elements.

## Updates

## Notes
You will thank yourself if you take detailed notes. Try and be as thorough as possible, even writing things down that you think "I won't forget this." Trust me: there's a good chance you will forget.
Consider making a record of the following:
- Any deviations made from this guide
- Draw a "map" of your folders and files.
- Draw a "map" of your physical devices.
- Your router settings and IP addresses.
- Passwords (highly recommend a password manager like 1Password)

## Backup Data
Shit is going to happen. SBCs like the RockPro64 are awesome little devices but t're more sensitive.

## Backup Power
I highly recommend getting a Universal Power Supply (UPS). SBCs are particularly sensitive to inconsistent electricity. A UPS will help ensure that your server is receiving clean, reliable power at all times.
Additionally, sudden loss of power can result in data loss or software malfunctions. A UPS also protects against those events.
The size of the UPS is up to you. I have two: one for my modem, router, and a couple of other SBCs; and another for the server itself.
Be sure and get one with "pure sine wave output" as this is best for sensitive electronics.
My RockPro64 Server only pulls about 5 to 8 Watts and the UPS has a 600W battery. In the event of a power outage, the UPS can keep the server up for 600W / 8W = 75 hours! Plenty of time to get home and fix the problem or safely shut the computer down.

## Upgrades
Some upgrades to look into as I (we) level up:
1. Docker Swarm
2. Security
3.
